What is Time / Space Complexity?

- It is a way of describing how an algorithm / function scales based on size of input.

Ideal Time / Space complexity?

- Constant Time / Space
- Linear Time / Space
- Quadratic (n^?)

Worst Case?
O(?)
Constant O(c) / O(1)
Linear O(n)
Quadratic O(n^2)

Space Complexity: Anything additional the function is adding to memory.
Time Complexity: Number of operations.
